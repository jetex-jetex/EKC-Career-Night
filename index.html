              I studied Computer Science and Mathematics with a concentration in Data Science at
              Eastern Connecticut State University. After graduating, I joined Travelers Insurance,
              where I've spent almost six years building the data systems that help one of the country's
              largest insurance companies make smarter decisions. I'm here today because I wish someone
              had shown me this path when I was in high school — I hope you find something useful in
              our conversation!

        <h2>What I Do (Day in the Life)</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>data engineer</strong> builds the roads and highways that data travels on.
          We write code to collect, clean, and move information so that other people —
          like data scientists, managers, and app teams — can actually use it.
          Think of it like plumbing, but for data instead of water.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check data pipelines and dashboards to make sure everything is running smoothly (a <em>pipeline</em> is a set of steps that automatically moves and processes data).</li>
          <li>Build and improve those pipelines with code — mostly SQL and Python.</li>
          <li>Work with teammates to understand exactly what data they need and in what shape.</li>
          <li>Debug problems when data looks wrong or stops flowing correctly.</li>

        <h2>How a Data Pipeline Works</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>data pipeline</strong> is a series of automatic steps that move data from where it's created
          to where it's useful. Here's a real-world example using Spotify — every time you play a song,
          something like this happens behind the scenes:
